WebSocket Server Architecture
========================================
This script manages WebSocket connections, Redis message handling, and game state synchronization.
It acts as a bridge between players by ensuring real-time communication through WebSockets.

1. **Matchmaking and room assignment**
   - players request matchmaking via `/api/pong/matchmaking/`
   - the matchmaking API assigns them to a room or creates a new one
   - player information is stored in Redis and a `player_joined` event is published
   - once a room is full, a `start_game` event is triggered

2. **Websocket connections**
   - when a player joins a game, they connect via WebSockets using their `room_id` and `player_id`
   - the `handler` function processes WebSocket messages and routes them accordingly.
   - messages are broadcasted to all players in the room via `broadcast_to_room`

3. **redis integration for game events**
   - redis acts as a message broker for real-time updates
   - `redis_listener()` listens for events such as `start_game` and `update_position`
   - when a new event is received, it is forwarded to connected players via WebSockets

4. **handling player actions (movement, score updates, etc.)*
   - players send movement updates via WebSockets (`player_move`)
   - the server distirbutes these updates to all clients in the room
   - movement is validated and synchronized across players

## file references:
- `frontend/src/js/WebSocketService.js` - manages WebSocket connections on the client side
- `frontend/src/js/games/gamePong/js/utils/GameWebSocketHandlers.js` - processes incoming websocket messages
- `frontend/src/js/games/gamePong/js/utils/PlayerInput.js` - sends player input data to the server

## key functions in main.py:
- `handler(websocket, path)`: manages websocket connections per player
- `redis_listener()`: listens for game events from redis and forwards them to Websocket clients
- `notify_players(room_id, message)`: Sends messages to all players in a room
- `broadcast_to_room(room_id, message, exclude=None)`: broadcatss a message to all players except the sender
- `register_player(websocket, room_id, player_id, username, gameMode)`: registers a player to the room and informs others
- `unregister_player(websocket, room_id, player_id, gameMode)`: handles player disconnection cleanup
- `start_game(room_id)`: triggers game start when a room is full
